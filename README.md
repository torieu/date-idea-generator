# Date Idea Generator

The Date Idea Generator is a simple web application that provides couples with random date ideas. The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, Firestore as its database, and hosted using Firebase.

## Features

- **vymyslet nový nápad!:** With a click of a button, the user can get a random date idea.
- **díky, odranděno:** Once the couple goes on the date, they can mark it as "done" to update its timestamp.
- **Stochastic Generation:** The application doesn't always present the oldest idea but rather takes a stochastic approach, favoring older date ideas but not guaranteeing them.

## TODO
- improve the stochastic probabilites to a distribution which takes newer date ideas into account more
